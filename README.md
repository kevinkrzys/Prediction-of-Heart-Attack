# Prediction of Heart Attack

#### This project uses the [Heart Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) to identify major contributors of Heart Attack and to predict patients with a high chance of having Heart Attack.

## Survey

#### We surveyed 84 people to find out what they thought were the major contributors to Heart Attack and here is what they said:
![Survey Result 1](https://github.com/kevinkrzys/Prediction-of-Heart-Attack/blob/master/Survey%20Results%202.png)

#### **72.6%** said **Cholesterol** whereas **48.8%** said **Age**

#### But are these really the biggest contributors to Heart Attack? This project aims to explore exactly that

## Models Used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. StepAIC
3. Decision Tree

## Major Contributors Identified
1. Values for Thalassemia (Normal/Fixed Defect/Reversable Defect)
2. The number of major vessels colored by Fluoroscopy (0 - 3)
3. Maximum heart rate achieved
4. Chest pain type (Typical Angina/Atypical Angina/Non-Anginal Pain/Asymptomatic)

### We achieved an accuracy of **86.67%** using the Decision Tree Model
